** User Story ** When browser loads, player has option to press "Start" Once player presses start, the game board opens up, with cards-back being the cards' class on load. Once player clicks start, timer will become visible and begin. Each card has a match in the deck. If the length of a card is 2, then we check our handOfCards array and run our match cards function to see if the two cards are matches. Matched by their ID, the cards are either added to a "matched" or "noMatch" variable. If the the player mismatches 3 cards, then the game is lost and the page is refreshed. Otherwise, if the timer runs out and the player gets less than 3 mismatched cards, then "Times up!" and the amount of matches is displayed. The start button and card container are hidden when the timer runs out.
